## Whenever an element occupies the  100% avaiable length then it is a block level element

## display properties specifies whether it is block or inline element


## The width and height are not applicable for inline elements so to make them access we uuse display:inline-block property

## Even a img is also an inline element but it can access the width and height property directly without need of display:inline-block because internally img element has inline-block display property
