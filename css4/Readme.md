## The list-style-type CSS property specifies the bullet or numbering style for lists (<ul>, <ol>, and <li>). It allows you to change the marker (such as a bullet, number, or other characters) used in front of each list item.



## The list-style-position property specifies the position of the list marker (bullet or number) in relation to the list itemâ€™s content. There are two possible values:

## outside (default): The marker is outside the list item's content box. The list marker is rendered outside the content, and the content of the list item is indented.

## inside: The marker is inside the list item's content box. The marker appears as part of the text, and the content will align with the marker. (SEE CSS FILE)


# Styling Links


## Unvisited Link (a):
By default, unvisited links are underlined and typically appear in blue.

## Visited Link (a:visited):
Once a link has been clicked, its color changes (often to purple), depending on the browser's default settings or the specified CSS.

## Hover (a:hover):
When the user hovers over a link, you can apply different styles like changing the color or removing the underline. This makes it interactive.

## Focus (a:focus):
This pseudo-class is used to style a link when it receives focus (e.g., when navigated to via keyboard).

## Active Link (a:active):
When the link is actively clicked, the style (often in red) is applied. It appears while the mouse button is held down.
