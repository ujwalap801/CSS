## Style of CSS

## CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS controls how elements on a web page are displayed, including layout, colors, fonts, and spacing.

## Key Features of CSS:

### Separation of content and design: 
CSS allows you to separate the content (HTML) from the design (styles), making it easier to maintain and update the appearance of a website without changing its structure.

### Cascading: 
The "Cascading" part refers to the way CSS applies rules. Multiple styles can be applied to the same HTML element, and the browser will determine which styles take precedence, based on specificity, importance, and source order.

### Reusability: 
CSS allows you to define a set of styles once and reuse them throughout multiple pages or elements.

### Responsive Design:
 CSS helps create layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, making websites responsive on mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
